# Fraud-Detection-Using-Trust-Rank-Algorithm
Applied the Trust Rank algorithm to identify potential bad senders in a transactional network. Built a graph from transaction data and iteratively propagated fraud scores from known bad senders to detect new potential bad actors. Successfully identified 47 additional bad senders, enhancing fraud detection capabilities.
